# Heart Disease Prediction

This is my Bonus Project for the course- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.
It is Deployed at: [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/amanthakur64/heartdiseaseprediction)



## Aim
To Predict the likelihood of developing a heart disease based on a short Behavorial Survey

## What is Heart Disease?

The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.

## Dataset

I have used the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease,
which is a cleaned version of the 2020 annual CDC survey data of 400k adults related to their health status.
You can find the original dataset here: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html

- Random Forests (Sklearn)
- Logistic Regression (Sklearn)
- Neural Network (PyTorch)
